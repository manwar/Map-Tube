=head1 DESCRIPTION

Cookbook for L<Map::Tube> library.

=head1 CREATE A MAP

C<Map::Tube v3.22> or above now supports map data in XML and JSON format. Here is
the structure of a map in XML format:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <tube name="Your-Map-Name">
        <lines>
           <line id="Line-ID"
                 name="Line-Name"
                 color="Line-Color-Code" />
           .....
           .....
           .....
           .....
        </lines>

        <stations>
           <station id="Station-ID"
                    name="Station-Name"
                    line="Line-ID:Station-Index"
                    link="Station-ID"
                    other_link="Link-Name:Station-ID" />
           .....
           .....
           .....
           .....
        </stations>
    </tube>

And the same in JSON format:

   {
       "name"  : "Your-Map-Name",
       "lines" : {
           "line" : [
               { "id"    : "Line-ID",
                 "name"  : "Line-Name",
                 "color" : "Line-Color-Code"
               },
               .....
               .....
               .....
               .....
           ]
       },
       "stations" : {
           "station" : [
               { "id"         : "Station-ID",
                 "name"       : "Station-Name",
                 "line"       : "Line-ID:Station-Index",
                 "link"       : "Station-ID",
                 "other_link" : "Link-Name:Station-ID"
               },
               .....
               .....
               .....
               .....
           ]
       }
   }

A more rigorous description of the requirements will be given
L<below|/FORMAL-REQUIREMENTS-FOR-MAPS>. Let us start with an informal
introduction.

The root of the XML data is C<tube> which has one optional attribute
C<name>, i.e. map name, and two children:  C<lines> and C<stations>.

The node C<lines> has one or more C<line> children. The node C<line>
defines one 'line' of the map. The node C<line> has to have the
attributes C<id> and C<name>. Optionally it can have C<color> as well.
They are explained below:

    +------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Attribute  | Description                                                   |
    +------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |            |                                                               |
    | id         | Unique line id of the map. It should consist of printable     |
    |            | characters from 7-bit ASCII. It shouldn't contain "," or ":". |
    |            |                                                               |
    | name       | Line name of the map. It should be unique since this name is  |
    |            | what end users will typically use.                            |
    |            |                                                               |
    | color      | Line color is optional. It should have color name or hexcode. |
    |            |                                                               |
    +------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Example from L<Map::Tube::Delhi> as shown below:

    <line id="Red" name="Red" color="#8B0000" />

The node C<stations> has one or more C<station> children. The node
C<station> is used to represent a 'station' of the map. It must have
attributes C<id>, C<name>, C<line> and C<link>. It can optionally have
an attribute C<other_link>.

    +------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Attribute  | Description                                                   |
    +------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |            |                                                               |
    | id         | Unique line id of the map. It should consist of printable     |
    |            | characters from 7-bit ASCII. It shouldn't contain "," or ":". |
    |            |                                                               |
    | name       | Station name of the map. It should be unique since this name  |
    |            | is what end users will typically use.                         |
    |            |                                                               |
    | line       | Represents the station line along with the station index on   |
    |            | the line. It should be ":" separated, e.g. "Red:2", meaning   |
    |            | this is the second station on line 'Red'. Station index       |
    |            | is NOT mandatory but nice to have. If the station is served   |
    |            | by more than one line, they should all be listed, separated   |
    |            | by ",". For example, "Red:9,Green:16".                        |
    |            | The lines are referenced by id, not by name.                  |
    |            |                                                               |
    | link       | Represents all linked stations to this station, e.g. "B04"    |
    |            | If it is linked to more than one station, they should all be  |
    |            | listed, separated by ",". For example, "B04,B02".             |
    |            | The stations are referenced by id, not by name.               |
    |            |                                                               |
    | other_link | This attribute is optional. This is useful if the station is  |
    |            | linked via some other form of link and not by any of the      |
    |            | lines, e.g., some stations are linked by tunnel.              |
    |            | This can be defined as "Tunnel:B02".                          |
    |            |                                                               |
    +------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Example from L<Map::Tube::London> without station index:

    <station id="B003"
             name="Bank"
             line="Central,DLR,Northern,Waterloo &amp; City"
             link="S002,S024,L013,M011,L012,W008"
             other_link="Tunnel:M009" />

Example from L<Map::Tube::Delhi> with station index:

    <station id="B03"
             name="Dwarka Sector 9"
             line="Blue:3"
             link="B04,B02" />

Let us create an XML map for the following map:

      A(1)  ----  B(2)
     /              \
    C(3)  --------  F(6) --- G(7) ---- H(8)
     \              /
      D(4)  ----  E(5)

Below is the XML representation C<sample.xml> of the above map:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <tube name="Sample">
        <lines>
           <line id="L1" name="L1" />
        </lines>
        <stations>
           <station id="L01" name="A" line="L1:1" link="L02,L03"         />
           <station id="L02" name="B" line="L1:2" link="L01,L06"         />
           <station id="L03" name="C" line="L1:3" link="L01,L04,L06"     />
           <station id="L04" name="D" line="L1:4" link="L03,L05"         />
           <station id="L05" name="E" line="L1:5" link="L04,L06"         />
           <station id="L06" name="F" line="L1:6" link="L02,L03,L05,L07" />
           <station id="L07" name="G" line="L1:7" link="L06,L08"         />
           <station id="L08" name="H" line="L1:8" link="L07"             />
        </stations>
    </tube>

Next is the JSON representation C<sample.json> of the above map:

   {
       "name"     : "Sample",
       "lines"    : { "line"    : [ { "id" : "L1", "name" : "L1" } ] },
       "stations" : { "station" : [ { "id" : "L01", "name": "A", "line": "L1:1", "link": "L02,L03"         },
                                    { "id" : "L02", "name": "B", "line": "L1:2", "link": "L01,L06"         },
                                    { "id" : "L03", "name": "C", "line": "L1:3", "link": "L01,L04,L06"     },
                                    { "id" : "L04", "name": "D", "line": "L1:4", "link": "L03,L05"         },
                                    { "id" : "L05", "name": "E", "line": "L1:5", "link": "L04,L06"         },
                                    { "id" : "L06", "name": "F", "line": "L1:6", "link": "L02,L03,L05,L07" },
                                    { "id" : "L07", "name": "G", "line": "L1:7", "link": "L06,L08"         },
                                    { "id" : "L08", "name": "H", "line": "L1:8", "link": "L07"             }
                                  ]
                    }
   }

=head2 FORMAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MAPS

These are the requirements for map files. (In the following we will use XML syntax and
terminology, which straightforwardly translates into JSON.)

=over 4

=item * Map files SHOULD be UTF8-coded.

=item * All C<id>s and names of both lines and stations are treated as case-insensitive, i.e.,
        C<MYNAME>, C<myname>, and C<MyName> are considered to be identical.

=item * The top level element MUST be a C<< <tube> >> element. It MAY have a C<name> attribute
        giving the human-readable name of the map.
        It MAY also have other attributes, which will in general be ignored by L<Map::Tube>.

=item * Under C<< <tube> >>, there MUST be exactly one C<< <lines> >> and exactly one
        C<< <stations> >> element.

=item * Under the C<< <lines> >> element, there MUST be one or more C<< <line> >> elements,
        each completely defining one tube line.

=item * Each tube line used in the map MUST have exactly one defining C<< <line> >> element.
        All defined lines MUST be mentioned at at least two stations.

=item * Each C<< <line> >> element MUST have an C<id> attribute and a C<name> attribute.
        It MAY have a C<color> attribute.
        It MAY also have other attributes, which will in general be ignored by L<Map::Tube>.

=item * The value of the C<id> attribute SHOULD consist of 7-bit printing characters without
        spaces. It MUST NOT contain a comma (",") or a colon (":"). In general, it will be a
        rather short string, but this is not required. Each C<id> MUST be unique among the lines.
        Line C<id>s are case-insensitive, so any two line C<id>s MUST NOT differ only in case.
        Any line C<id> SHOULD NOT occur also as a station C<id>. C<id>s are usually not seen by
        end users.

=item * The C<name> attribute MAY be any string. It MUST be unique among the lines (but it MAY
        be the same as a station C<name>). Typically, end users will interact with these names,
        so this should be kept in mind when choosing names.

=item * The C<color> attribute MAY specify the color which graphical representations of the map
        SHOULD use for this line. The value MUST be either a color in HTML-style triple-hexadecimal
        code (C<#RRGGBB>) or one of a set of color names predefined in C<share/color-names.txt>.

=item * Under the C<< <stations> >> element, there MUST be two or more C<< <station> >> elements,
        each completely defining one tube station.

=item * Each tube station used in the map MUST have exactly one defining C<< <station> >> element.
        Even if a station is served by more than one line, there MUST NOT be more than one
        C<< <station> >> element for this station.

=item * Each C<< <station> >> element MUST have an C<id> attribute, a C<name> attribute, a C<line>
        attribute and a C<link> attribute. It MAY have an C<other_link> attribute.
        It MAY also have other attributes, which will in general be ignored by L<Map::Tube>.

=item * The value of the C<id> attribute SHOULD consist of 7-bit printing characters without
        spaces. It MUST NOT contain a comma (",") or a colon (":"). In general, it will be a
        rather short string, but this is not required. Each C<id> MUST be unique among the stations.
        Station C<id>s are case-insensitive, so two station's C<id>s MUST NOT differ only in case.
        Any station C<id> SHOULD NOT occur also as a line C<id>. C<id>s are usually not seen by
        end users.

=item * The C<name> attribute MAY be any string. It MUST be unique among the stations (but it
        MAY be the same as a line C<name>). Typically, end users will interact with these names,
        so this should be kept in mind when choosing names.

=item * The value of the C<line> attribute MUST be a list of one or more I<line-spec>s. If there
        is more than one I<line-spec>, they MUST be separated by commas (","). Lines MUST NOT
        be named more than once in any station's C<line> attribute.

=item * A I<line-spec> MUST consist of a defined line C<id>, which MAY be followed by a colon
        (":") and a positive integer. The line C<id> signifies a line serving this station. If the
        extended form is used, the integer signifies the position of this station on the line.
        Typically, the station at one (arbitrarily chosen) end will be denoted by 1, the next one
        by 2, etc. The numbers NEED NOT be consecutive, but they MUST be in strictly increasing
        order.

=item * Each line MUST either throughout use the extended I<line-spec> form or the short form.
        Any given line MUST NOT use the extended form at some stations and the short form at
        others. However, different lines MAY differ in this respect from each other.

=item * The value of the C<link> attribute MUST be a list of one or more defined station C<id>s.
        If there is more than one station, they MUST be separated by commas (","). Stations MUST
        NOT be named more than once in any station's C<link> attribute.

=item * For each line named by a station's C<line> attribute, at least one of the stations named
        in its C<link> atttribute MUST also name this line in its C<line> attribute.

=item * For each station named in a station's C<link> attribute there MUST be at least one line
        named in both these stations' C<line> attributes.

=item * If a station (say, with C<id> I<A>) names a station (say, with C<id> I<B>) in its C<link>
        attribute I<and> vice-versa, this is called a I<bidirectional> link, otherwise it is
        called a I<unidirectional> link.

=item * The value of the C<other_link> attribute, if present, MUST be a list of one or more
        I<other-link-spec>s. If there is more than one C<other-link-spec>, they MUST be separated
        by commas (","). An I<other-link-spec> describes a non-tube connection between two
        different stations, usually through some passageway, tunnel or escalator link.

=item * An C<other-link-spec> MUST consist of an identifier, followed by a colon (":"), followed
        by the C<id> of a defined station. The identifier doubles as both an id (in that it
        uniquely identifies an entity) and a name (in that it may be displayed to end users).
        As such, it SHOULD follow the rules for line C<id>s. The identifier MAY be the C<id> of
        a defined line. Any line C<id>  MUST NOT come up both in some station's C<line> attribute
        I<and> in some (possibly different) station's C<other_link> attribute.

=item * A station MAY be named both in another station's C<link> and its C<other_link> attributes,
        although this is unusual.

=item * For each C<other-link-spec> at some station (say, with C<id> I<A>) that names another
        station (say, with C<id> I<B>), there MUST be a corresponding C<other-link-spec> at
        station I<B> that uses the same identifier and names station I<A>. (In other words,
        C<other-link-spec>s MUST come in pairs, making all such connections bidirectional.)

=item * A station MUST NOT name itself in its C<link> attribute nor in its C<other_link>
        atttribute.

=item * Usually, lines are I<connected> in the sense that any station on a given line is
        reachable from each other station on the same line. However, this is not required.

=item * Usually, maps are I<connected> in the sense that any station on the map is
        reachable from each other station on the map. However, this is not required.

=item * As indicated above, maps MAY also use attributes other than those mentioned above. These
        will in general be ignored by most L<Map::Tube> software. However, your software may make
        use of the additional data either for its own purposes, or it may make these attributes
        usable for L<Map::Tube>. E.g., L<Map::Tube::Beijing> and L<Map::Tube::Hongkong> (q.v.) both
        use additional C<name_alt> attributes in order to provide not only Latin-script (Pinyin)
        versions of the names but, as an alternative, also Han (Chinese script) names. The version
        to use is decided when the L<Map::Tube> object is instantiated. (This could also be used to
        specify alternative station names in I<n>-lingual areas (where I<n> > 1).)

=head1 WORK WITH A MAP

You would need C<Map::Tube> v3.22 or above to be able to support the JSON format.

The following code manages map data in XML format:

    package Sample::Map;

    use Moo;
    use namespace::clean;

    has xml => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 'sample.xml' });
    with 'Map::Tube';

    package main;
    use strict; use warnings;

    my $map = Sample::Map->new;
    print $map->get_shortest_route('A', 'D');

In order to support map data in JSON format, just replace the line below:

    has xml => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 'sample.xml' });

with

    has json => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 'sample.json' });

=head1 MAP GRAPH

To print the entire map or just a particular line map, just install the
plugin L<Map::Tube::Plugin::Graph> and you have all the tools to create
map image.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use MIME::Base64;
    use Sample::Map;

    my $map  = Sample::Map->new;
    my $name = $map->name;
    open(my $MAP_IMAGE, ">$name.png");
    binmode($MAP_IMAGE);
    print $MAP_IMAGE decode_base64($map->as_image);
    close($MAP_IMAGE);

=head1 FUZZY FIND

To enable the fuzzy search ability to the sample map, you would need to
install L<Map::Tube::Plugin::FuzzyFind> and you have everything you need
to perform the task.

=head1 VALIDATE MAP

There is a handy package L<Test::Map::Tube> that can help you in testing
the basic map structure and functionalities.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use Test::More;

    my $min_ver = 0.09;
    eval "use Test::Map::Tube $min_ver tests => 2";
    plan skip_all => "Test::Map::Tube $min_ver required" if $@;

    use Sample::Map;
    my $map = Sample::Map->new;
    ok_map($map);
    ok_map_functions($map);

=head1 SEARCH ALGORITHM

Map::Tube uses L<Dijkstra's
Algorithm|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm>, invented
and published by computer science pioneer L<Edsger W.
Dijkstra|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra> in the 1950s.

Let us take this sample map.

        1 -------- 2
       /  \      /   \
      /    \    /     \
     0 ------ 6 ------ 3
      \     /  \      /
       \   /    \    /
        5 -------- 4

We would build a table initially as follows:

    +--------+---------------+
    | Vertex | Path | Length |
    +--------+------+--------+
    | 0      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 1      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 2      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 3      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 4      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 5      |  -   |  INF   |
    | 6      |  -   |  INF   |
    +--------+------+--------+

In the table, the index on the left represents the vertex we are going
to (for convenience, we will assume that we are starting at vertex 0).
The Path field tells us which vertex precedes us in the path. The
Length field is the length of the path from the starting vertex to that
vertex, which we initialize to INFinity under the assumption that there
is no path unless we find one, in which case the length will be less
than infinity.

We begin by indicating that 0 can reach itself with a path of length 0.
This is better than infinity, so we replace INF with 0 in the Length
column, and we also place a 0 in the Path column. Now we look at 0's
neighbors. All three of 0's neighbors 1, 5, and 6 can be reached from 0
with a path of length 1 (1 + the length of the path to 0, which is 0),
and for all three of them this is better than INFinity, so we update
their Path and Length fields and then enqueue them because we will have
to look at their neighbors next.

We dequeue 1, and look at its neighbors 0, 2, and 6. The path through
vertex 1 to each of those vertices would have a length of 2 (1 + the
length of the path to 1, which is 1). For 0 and 6 this is worse than
what is already in their Length field so we will do nothing for them.
For 2, the path of length 2 is better than infinity, so we will put 2 in
its Length field and 1 in its Path field, since it came from 1, and then
we will enqueue it so we can eventually look at its neighbors if
necessary.

We dequeue the 5 and look at its neighbors 0, 4, and 6. The path through
vertex 5 to each of those vertices would have a length of 2 (1 + the
length of the path to 5, which is 1). For 0 and 6, this is worse than
what is already in their Length field, so we will do nothing for them.
For 4, the path of length 2 is better than infinity, so we will put 2 in
its Length field and 5 in its Path field, since it came from 5, and then
we will enqueue it so we can eventually look at its neighbors if
necessary.

Next we dequeue the 6, which shares an edge with each of the other six
vertices. The path through 6 to any of these vertices would have a
length of 2, but only vertex 3 currently has a higher Length (infinity),
so we will update 3's fields and enqueue it.

Of the remaining items in the queue the path through them to their
neighbors will all have a length of 3, since they all have a length of
2, which will be worse than the values that are already in the Length
fields of all the vertices, so we will not make any more changes to the
table. The result is the following table:

    +--------+---------------+
    | Vertex | Path | Length |
    +--------+------+--------+
    | 0      |  0   |  0     |
    | 1      |  0   |  1     |
    | 2      |  1   |  2     |
    | 3      |  6   |  2     |
    | 4      |  5   |  2     |
    | 5      |  0   |  1     |
    | 6      |  0   |  1     |
    +--------+------+--------+

Now if we need to know how far away a vertex is from vertex 0, we can
look it up in the table.
